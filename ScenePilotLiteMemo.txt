Thank you for using Scene Pilot Lite! Think this is great?  Wouldn't it be nice to see where you're going to end up before you actually go there?  The full version has a preview window that allows you to adjust the rotation and position of your final destination before you fly!  Choose which layers can be raycasted to!  Plus many new features are being added regularly such as Scene Bookmarks which is coming soon!  Come have a look!  Get the link at Window > Scene Pilot Lite > Get Full Version and watch a few videos of it in action.
